## About Detroit

Detroit is internationally recognized as a global hub of industrial and product design. The region has served as a birthplace and testing ground for many influential modernist designers including Charles and Ray Eames, Florence Knoll, Eliel and Eero Saarinen, and Minoru Yamasaki. In 2015, Detroit was designated a UNESCO City of Design and continues to host the annual Detroit Month of Design, which celebrates the city’s vibrant and expanding creative ecosystem.

Today, Detroit supports a growing network of design professionals, fabrication specialists, and technology innovators. The city’s strong culture of making, experimentation, and interdisciplinary collaboration closely aligns with ACADIA’s focus on computational design, digital fabrication, and emerging design technologies.

## Architecture and Design Culture

Detroit offers a remarkable architectural landscape representing multiple eras of design, technological innovation, and urban development.

The city’s historic downtown features major Art Deco landmarks such as the Guardian Building and the Fisher Building, both celebrated for their elaborate material expression and craftsmanship. Modernist architecture is equally prominent, including Lafayette Park, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and One Woodward Avenue by Minoru Yamasaki.

Recent revitalization efforts further highlight Detroit’s design leadership. The transformation of Michigan Central Station into a global innovation hub and the development of NewLab Detroit demonstrate the city’s ongoing commitment to technological research, mobility innovation, and design entrepreneurship.

Nearby, the Cranbrook Educational Community in Bloomfield Hills represents one of the most influential centers for architecture, art, and design education in North America. Designed in part by Eliel Saarinen, Cranbrook continues to serve as a foundational institution in American modernist design history.
