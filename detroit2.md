# Conference City: Detroit  

The 2026 ACADIA conference will take place in **Detroit, Michigan**. Detroit, a metropolis of more than six million people, is recognized as a global hub of industrial design and the creative heart of Michigan. Shaped by its powerful industrial
past, the city became a cradle of American modernist design and home to iconic figures such as Charles and Ray Eames, Florence Knoll, Eliel and Eero Saarinen, and Minoru Yamasaki. Today, Detroit’s design sector employs more than 45,000 people and generates over $2.5 billion in wages, acting as a
central driver of economic growth and urban regeneration. In 2015, Detroit became the first U.S. city to receive UNESCO’s designation as a City of Design, joining the Creative Cities Network. Among its initiatives, the annual Detroit Month of Design brings together local and international talent through exhibitions, installations, and workshops, showcasing the city’s creativity and reinforcing its global reputation for innovation. Detroit never left.  

The academic host for ACADIA 2026 is **Lawrence Technological University**.  
LTU was forged in the crucible of the American industrial revolution. Its story begins in the 1930s, in the shadow of Henry Ford's Highland Park
Plant, the very cradle of modern manufacturing and Fordism. LTU witnessed the times when the iconic Model T reached its milestone of 1,000 cars produced in a single day, embodying the energy of mass production and industrial ingenuity. Today, LTU stands as one of only 13 private, technological,
doctoral universities in the United States, with a focus on technology and the tools that equip society to confront the wicked problems of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This origin story also instilled LTU’s DNA: a gritty, roll-up-your-sleeves mentality, rooted in “Theory and Practice,” that continues to define its people and purpose in the age of AI.

# Detroit Architecture  
Detroit and its surroundings offer a rich collection of Art Deco landmarks and signature works by architects such as Mies van der Rohe, Minoru Yamasaki, and Philip Johnson. The recently restored Michigan Central Station is emerging as a new cultural hub in Corktown. 
Plan a walking tour through Midtown and Downtown to experience this architectural heritage, or a field trip 10 miles north to visit the Cranbrook Academy of Art campus.

# Transportation  

**Detroit Wayne County International Airport (DTW)** is a major Delta hub with access to public transportation, ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, and official taxis. Note that there are two terminals at DTW; the larger Delta terminal is McNamara Terminal, while all other airlines arrive at the smaller North Terminal. The **Detroit Air Xpress** bus connects the airport to Downtown Detroit with 16 trips daily at $6-8 USD. Public transport options within Detroit include the **Detroit People Mover** and the **QLINE tram**.  

However, the greater Metro Detroit area is a car-centric metropolis, so it is generally recommended to use ride-sharing services or taxis when traveling outside of central Detroit.
