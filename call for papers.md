# Calls for Submissions

## Conference Theme
Humanism Recoded

ACADIA 2026 invites scholars, designers, artists, and practitioners to submit original research, projects, and critical reflections that explore the evolving relationship between computation, making, and human experience. Under the theme Humanism Recoded, the conference foregrounds embodiment, cultural context, ethics, and collective intelligence as central drivers of computational design practice.

As artificial intelligence, robotics, automation, and advanced fabrication continue to transform architectural and design disciplines, ACADIA 2026 seeks contributions that reposition these technologies as tools for empathy, inclusion, and situated making. The conference emphasizes work that reconnects digital innovation with lived experience, material realities, and social responsibility, while critically examining the cultural implications of computational systems.

ACADIA 2026 welcomes submissions in the following categories:


SUBMISSION TYPES
Technical Papers

Full-length research papers presenting original methodologies, theoretical frameworks, computational systems, or design research that advance discourse in computation, fabrication, and culture.

Project Presentations

Built work, speculative prototypes, installations, or experimental workflows demonstrating the integration of computational tools with material, cultural, or social contexts.

Field Notes

Short-form submissions offering critical provocations, in-progress research, reflective observations, or emerging practices that engage computation through situated, experimental, or exploratory approaches.

All accepted submissions will be presented during the conference and published in the ACADIA 2026 Proceedings.
