# Calls for Submissions

## Conference Theme
Humanism Recoded

ACADIA 2026 invites scholars, designers, artists, and practitioners to submit original research, projects, and critical reflections that explore the evolving relationship between computation, making, and human experience. Under the theme Humanism Recoded, the conference foregrounds embodiment, cultural context, ethics, and collective intelligence as central drivers of computational design practice.

As artificial intelligence, robotics, automation, and advanced fabrication continue to transform architectural and design disciplines, ACADIA 2026 seeks contributions that reposition these technologies as tools for empathy, inclusion, and situated making. The conference emphasizes work that reconnects digital innovation with lived experience, material realities, and social responsibility, while critically examining the cultural implications of computational systems.

ACADIA 2026 welcomes submissions in the following categories:

Technical Papers

Full-length research papers presenting original methodologies, theoretical frameworks, computational systems, or design research that advance discourse in computation, fabrication, and culture.

Project Presentations

Built work, speculative prototypes, installations, or experimental workflows demonstrating the integration of computational tools with material, cultural, or social contexts.

Field Notes

Short-form submissions offering critical provocations, in-progress research, reflective observations, or emerging practices that engage computation through situated, experimental, or exploratory approaches.

All accepted submissions will be presented during the conference and published in the ACADIA 2026 Proceedings.

Submissions may address, but are not limited to, the following topics:

Robotics and Autonomous Systems

Digital Fabrication and Hybrid Craft

Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Generative Algorithms and Predictive Simulation

Extended Reality (VR, AR, MR)

Digital Heritage and Computational Preservation

Material Innovation and Bio-Design

Circular Construction and Low-Carbon Workflows

Human–Computer Interaction and Interactive Systems

Collective Intelligence and Multi-Agent Systems

Computational Design Methods and Simulation Frameworks

Digital Storytelling and Algorithmic Narratives

Computational Landscape and Territorial Design

Data, Ethics, and Algorithmic Bias

Pedagogies of Computational Design

Speculative Design and World-Building

Public Technologies and Equitable Infrastructures

Visual Culture and Digital Representation

Submissions will be organized across thematic tracks, including:

Machines That Care – Robotics and autonomous systems as partners in repair, craft, and cultural production

Embodied Codes – Computation situated in bodies, practices, and local contexts

Algorithmic Fictions – AI as narrator, collaborator, and storyteller

Material Worlds – Circular systems, craft traditions, and experimental fabrication

Eco-Digital Fusion – Living materials, synthetic ecologies, and environmental computation

Collective Intelligence – Shared authorship across humans, machines, and communities

Digital Commons – Technology as infrastructure for participation and equity

Temporal Layers – Computation, memory, and digital heritage

Speculative Grounds – Design fictions and cultural imaginaries

Climate Matters – Computational design within planetary urgencies

All submissions will undergo a double-blind peer review process coordinated by the Technical Chairs and Project Chairs in accordance with ACADIA standards. Submissions will be evaluated based on originality, rigor, relevance to the conference theme, and contribution to computational design research and practice.

Submission deadlines, templates, and formatting guidelines will be announced following approval by the ACADIA Board.
Updates will be posted on the ACADIA 2026 website.
