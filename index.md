# ACADIA 2026  
## Computing for Resilience

ACADIA 2026 will explore how computational design, digital fabrication, and emerging technologies can support resilient futures in architecture, urbanism, and the built environment. This year’s conference is hosted by **Lawrence Technological University’s College of Architecture and Design**, located in the Detroit metropolitan region — a city shaped by innovation, production, and reinvention.

The conference will bring together researchers, designers, educators, and industry leaders to examine how computation can strengthen ecological, social, and material resilience across scales. Through peer‑reviewed papers, workshops, exhibitions, and keynote events, ACADIA 2026 will highlight new methods, tools, and frameworks that respond to the challenges and opportunities of our rapidly changing world.
