## Workshop Description
Print–Scan–Adapt is a research-driven workflow developed at LAMÁQUINA that integrates sensing, data analysis, and adaptive control into large-scale 3D printing. Traditional extrusion processes often produce inconsistent results, with bead width and layer accuracy shifting due to speed, acceleration, and material flow. By combining real-time scanning with robotic parameter mapping, this workflow transforms fabrication challenges into data-driven design opportunities.

This workshop brings the research to life in a hands-on format, exploring feedback-driven control in large-scale pellet-based 3D printing. Pellet extrusion offers a sustainable alternative to filament deposition, supporting recycled polymers and industrial-scale output, yet the process is inherently unstable. Participants use a flange-mounted Intel RealSense depth camera to measure bead width during printing, correlating this data with robot speed and extrusion parameters via KUKA&#124;prc. The resulting mapping model predicts and adapts deposition outcomes, allowing participants to actively control material behavior.

Print–Scan–Adapt emphasizes computation as a tool for resilience at the material-process interface, turning unpredictable extrusion into a design opportunity. By deliberately guiding over- and under-extrusion, participants create patterned modules where material variability becomes an intentional aesthetic. The final outcome is a collective prototype — such as a column or arch — assembled from modules whose surface textures directly reflect the process feedback, demonstrating how sensing, computation, and design converge in large-scale additive fabrication.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- **Understand Pellet-Based Additive Manufacturing**: Identify and analyze the challenges of pellet extrusion, including flow instability, bead width variation, and die swell.
- **Integrate Sensing for Real-Time Feedback**: Set up and operate a scan-to-feedback workflow using Intel RealSense and Grasshopper, correlating robotic parameters with measured bead geometry.
- **Develop Predictive Toolpath Models**: Build width-mapping models that translate target bead sizes into adjustable toolpath parameters and control variable deposition as a design element.
- **Fabricate Adaptive, Data-Driven Modules**: Apply image-sampler logic and adaptive control to produce modules demonstrating material responsiveness and surface variation.
- **Collaborate on Collective Assemblies**: Contribute to a final prototype that embodies resilience, material intelligence, and computational design.
