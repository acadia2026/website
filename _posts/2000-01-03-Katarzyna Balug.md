Katarzyna Balug, PhD is a historian of modern and contemporary architecture. Her research explores feedback loops between techno-political change and subjectivity as mediated by architectural experiments. Balug’s current book project examines air-filled inflatable structures prevalent in the 1960s as a prescient meditation on human relations with the planet and its environment informed by the Space Race. Her curatorial work and public art practice reflect her commitment to making knowledge accessible and cultivating public space as a site of critique. Balug’s writing been published in, among others, Geoforum, Critical Sociology (co-authored), and the edited volume NASA in the American South (University of Florida Press).
