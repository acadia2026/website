 Luis Arturo Pacheco is an Assistant Professor of Architecture at Florida Atlantic University and Director of the [Interactive Machines Lab](https://www.fau.edu/artsandletters/architecture/research-labs/interactive-machines-lab/), where his research explores the intersection of computational design, robotics, and digital fabrication. His work focuses on developing intuitive robot control interfaces for creative professionals and advancing innovative workflows for digital manufacturing in construction. He is also a Doctor of Design candidate (2025) at FIU, with research centered on procedural robot control and integration interfaces in architectural robotics.

Luis is the creator of [Animaquina](www.animaquina.com), a Blender add-on for controlling robotic arms, and founder of [Neobrutal Studio](www.neobrutal.com), a consulting practice focused on additive manufacturing and robotics. He previously co-founded and served as CEO of MakerMex, Mexico’s first 3D printer manufacturing company, where he led the development of 3D printers, laser cutters, and custom robotic systems. He also co-founded MakerLab León and MakerScad, initiatives promoting open-source technologies and digital fabrication.

He holds a master’s degree in Robotics and Advanced Construction from IAAC in Barcelona and a bachelor’s degree in architecture from Universidad de La Salle  Bajío in Mexico. In 2016, he was recognized as one of Mexico’s MIT Innovators Under 35.
