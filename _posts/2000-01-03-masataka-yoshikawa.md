## Masataka Yoshikawa

Masataka Yoshikawa is an Assistant Professor of Architecture at Lawrence Technological University. His research centers on architectural representation and the contemporary design process, with a particular focus on how architects’ design sensibilities are evolving in the digital age. Through this work, he investigates new modes of design thinking and production that bridge conceptual exploration, technical experimentation, and built form.

Yoshikawa develops innovative design workflows that integrate 3D simulation, modeling across physical and virtual environments using extended reality, digital fabrication tools, and artificial intelligence. His practice and research examine how emerging technologies can expand architectural imagination while reshaping methods of representation, collaboration, and making.

His recent work was exhibited at the 2025 Venice Architecture Biennale. He is also a recipient of the 2025 Vision Awards and was selected as one of Architizer’s Visionary 100. His work has been published in a range of venues, including the *Ken Roberts Memorial Delineation Competition 50th Anniversary Book, Architectural Design, Architecture in Perspective, Officina, and Dimensions*.

In addition to his publications, Yoshikaa has presented his research at numerous conferences, including SIGraDi, VIBRArch, ARCC, BTES, CAADRIA, Alt+F4, SCULPT, and NCBDS. His work has also been featured in exhibitions and venues such as SARA NY ART, the University of Texas at Arlington, and the Republic Center in Dallas, among others.

Yoshikawa holds a Master of Architecture from the University of Michigan. Prior to joining academia, he practiced at PLY+ Architects in Michigan and Flying Elephant Studio in Bangalore, experiences that continue to inform his interdisciplinary approach to design, representation, and emerging technologies.
