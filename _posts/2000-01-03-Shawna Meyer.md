## Shawna Meyer 
Lecturer, UM

Shawna Meyer is a founding principal of Atelier Mey architecture practice based in Miami, FL and a lecturer at the University of Miami School of Architecture. The work of Atelier Mey acknowledges an obligation to confront the blase attitude towards architectural decision making, responsible for shaping the natural and built environments. Her work in practice, teaching and research exists at the confluence of social, cultural, economic and environmental forces. The overarching trajectory of Shawna’s career has been in pursuit of architectural attunement through the lens of energetics, matter, and the craft in their assembly. As principals of Atelier Mey, Shawna and Christopher received a 2021 AIA Honor Award for Sustainable Architects of the Year from Miami AIA and Small Firm of the Year 2022 AIA Miami. In 2022, Shawna was inducted into the John G. Williams Fellowship at the Fay Jones School of Architecture + Design.
